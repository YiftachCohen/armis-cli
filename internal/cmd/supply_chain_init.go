	Use:   "init",
	Short: "Set up local package age enforcement",
	Long: `Configure your shell to enforce package release age policies during installations.

This wraps every supported package manager found on your PATH so that armis-cli
can enforce age policies on package installations. The shell functions are global
(they apply in every directory), so init wraps what is installed on the machine,
not just what a single project uses; whether enforcement actually runs is decided
per-project at install time from the nearest .armis-supply-chain.yaml. Node PMs
(npm, npx, pnpm, bun, yarn) and pip/uv/uvx use a transparent proxy that filters
registry responses. poetry, pipenv, pdm, mvn, and gradle use a pre-install check
that blocks the build if violations are found.

Four modes are available:
  rc     — Inject shell functions into ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc / fish config /
           PowerShell profile (default, interactive)
  env    — Print an eval command for CI or manual sourcing
  npmrc  — Add a marker comment to .npmrc (the registry override itself is set
           dynamically by 'supply-chain wrap'; use with the rc or env modes)
  config — Generate .armis-supply-chain.yaml policy file for this project

Run 'armis-cli supply-chain uninit' to reverse the shell RC and .npmrc changes
made by this command. The --mode config policy file (.armis-supply-chain.yaml) is
meant to be committed and shared with your team, so uninit leaves it in place;
remove it manually if you no longer want it.`,
	Example: `  # Interactive setup (default)
  armis-cli supply-chain init

  # See what would be modified
  armis-cli supply-chain init --dry-run

  # Non-interactive (CI friendly)
  armis-cli supply-chain init --yes

  # Print eval command for CI
  armis-cli supply-chain init --mode env

  # Add the supply-chain marker comment to .npmrc
  armis-cli supply-chain init --mode npmrc

  # Generate a committable .armis-supply-chain.yaml for this project

//     (allSupportedPMs omits both). Each is paired with its base PM — and wrapped

%s
# Restrict enforcement to specific ecosystems (default: all detected).
# Supported: npm, pnpm, bun, yarn, pip, poetry, pipenv, pdm, uv, maven, gradle
# NOTE: if you set "ecosystems" below, any "registries" entry for an excluded
# ecosystem is ignored — scoping enforcement out also scopes out its routing.
# ecosystems:
#   - npm
#   - pip

# Approved corporate registry per ecosystem (Nexus / JFrog Artifactory).
# When set, wrapped installs route through this registry (with your existing
# credentials forwarded) and CI 'check' flags packages resolved elsewhere.
#   - npm:  the npm group/proxy repo URL.
#   - pypi: the PyPI index URL — it MUST end in /simple/ (PEP 503).
# Credentials are read from your NATIVE config, never from this file:
#   - npm:  .npmrc  //host/path/:_authToken=...   (use _authToken, NOT _auth;
#           the legacy base64 _auth form is not supported in this version)
#   - pip:  the userinfo embedded in your index-url (https://user:token@host/...)
# registries:
#   npm: https://nexus.corp/repository/npm-group/
#   pypi: https://nexus.corp/repository/pypi-group/simple/

# Routing enforcement posture. Only "warn" is supported in this version:
# it prints a one-time notice when your effective registry is explicitly
# off-policy. ("block" is rejected at load time — it is not yet implemented,
# and silently downgrading it would give a false sense of enforcement.)
# registry-enforcement: warn

# Optional CA bundle (PEM) for the proxy's TLS connection to the registry, for
# a Nexus fronted by a corporate/private CA. Overridable via ARMIS_REGISTRY_CA_BUNDLE.
# registry-ca-bundle: /etc/ssl/corp-ca.pem

# If true, allow installs when the registry is unreachable
